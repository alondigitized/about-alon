# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## About Alan
- Values first-principles thinking, critical analysis, truth over comfort
- Prefers minimal, clean aesthetics (chose text-only over avatar on web page)
- Primary channel: Telegram (chat ID: 8507395629)
- GitHub: alondigitized

## Projects
- **about-alon**: Personal web page (dark, monospace, text-only). Deployed on GitHub Pages at https://alondigitized.github.io/about-alon/
- **Notion Activity Log**: Log all completed tasks with timestamps to "Open Claw Log" page (ID: 308bb013-6214-8009-9f33-ff59f7a3876d)

## Standing Rules
- Log EVERYTHING to this page with timestamps (PST) — completed tasks, scheduled tasks, background work, memory updates, no exceptions
- Be direct, no fluff, no positive bias

## Setup Notes
- GitHub CLI installed via Homebrew, authenticated as alondigitized
- Telegram paired and working with chat ID 8507395629
- Notion integration connected, API key managed
- Brave Search API key configured (though experiencing persistent issues)
